     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rajarshi Shahu Mahavidyalaya (Autonomous), Latur, the higher educational institute of Shiv Chhatrapati Shikshan Sanstha, was established in 1970. In the beginning, we had to fight for survival due to the problems of accommodation, finance and non-recognition by the elite class of the society of this region. The adverse situation was in a real sense proved to be a boon and an opportunity to us. We aim at providing quality education to the underprivileged students of the region. It started functioning since June 1970 with just 51 students in the undergraduate programs of Arts and Commerce and introduced UG Science in 1971, then affiliated to Marathwada University, Aurangabad. The institute had gone through a chain of adverse situations and a tuff journey for a decade like an Ancient Mariner. In 1978, a history was created as three out of three University merits in UG Commerce were from our institute which brought name, fame and recognition to the institute. Since then, the tradition of merit has been maintained with the motto-Pursuit of Excellence.

     <p2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       We are now known for academic autonomy, plurality, peculiarity and leadership. Our experiments, excellence and the tradition of merit in education have created the Shahu Pattern of Education. Shahu Pattern is devotion, dedication, consistent and untiring striving by inspired teachers, motivated students helped by hard working non-teaching staff, encouraged with ideas and incentives, non-interference, insistence on idealism, ethical values, excellence in education by the management - all put together makes a driving force - an Engine. Yes - this is Shahu Pattern widely known as Latur Pattern of education. This pattern has shaped hundreds and hundreds of toppers in Board and University Examinations specially those coming from rural area and made us one of the premier institutes of the region. Every year 500 to 600 students from this college seek admission to medical colleges in India. In academic year 2018-19, 26 students got AIR rank in AIIMS, 32 students got AIR rank in JEE Advanced Examination and 532 students got more than 500 marks in NEET Examination. This is the institute from where maximum numbers of students go to medical and engineering colleges in India.

         To do innovative experiments in education and maintain the consistency in experimentation, ours is the first institute to go for academic autonomy in Marathwada region in 2013.
